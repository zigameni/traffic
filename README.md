# Traffic
In this project, we use TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, 
we'll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

The dataset was not uploaded, it was about 200mb.
